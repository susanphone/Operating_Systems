# Preview for test 3
Oct 18- Nov 12
* Diffie-Hellman's algo (key exchange)
* RSA, applications:
    1. send/receive message
    2. digital signature
* Multiprocessor Scheduling
* Real-Time OS (Earliest Deadline First, Rate Monotone Scheduling, and Least Laxity First(LLF))
* Queueing Analysis (Only for Single-Server System)
* Distributed Mutual Exclusion (timestamp algorithm, 3(N-1) algorithm, Bully and Ringbase leader election)
    * 2(N-1) solution and N solution will NOT be on the test
## What to do
* Look at pop-up tests
* Implement algorithms
* Formulas
