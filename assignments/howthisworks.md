Implement a paging system
    Job number      bytes
        1           4069

Struct Job_number 
    int job number
    int bytes

Need functions:
    print
    exit
    Read_command
    execute_command


If the bytes is greater than 0, than add job to queue
else remove job from queue, to done array

Replace current job using queue

Todo Queue
If a job will not fit in the queue, then put in the back of the queue.

Done array for completed jobs
Malloc 4069 bytes per page
bytes / page = frames needed in memory
