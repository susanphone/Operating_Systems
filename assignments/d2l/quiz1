Saved
A monolithic kernel is implemented as a single process with all elements sharing the same address space.

Question 13 options:
	True
	False
Question 14 (1 point) 
Saved

Question 16 options:

time slicing


multithreading


round robin


clock cycle

Question 17 (1 point) 
Saved
In a time-sharing system, a user's program is preempted at regular intervals, but due to relatively slow human reaction time this occurrence is usually transparent to the user.
